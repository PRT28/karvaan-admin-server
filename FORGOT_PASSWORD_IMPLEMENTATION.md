# Forgot Password Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a secure forgot password functionality that follows the business-centric architecture. When a user requests a password reset, the system sends a notification email to their business administrator instead of directly resetting the password.

## 🔐 Security Flow

### 1. **User Request**
- User enters their email address
- System validates the email and finds the associated business
- No information is revealed about whether the email exists (security best practice)

### 2. **Business Admin Notification**
- System identifies the business administrator for the user's business
- Sends detailed notification email to the business admin
- Includes user details and timestamp for audit purposes

### 3. **Admin Action**
- Business admin receives notification with user details
- Admin can verify the request legitimacy
- Admin handles password reset through admin panel or direct contact

## 📧 Email Notification Details

### **Sent To**: Business Administrator
### **Contains**:
- User's name and email
- Business name
- Request timestamp
- Security warnings
- Next steps for the admin

### **Email Template Features**:
- Professional HTML formatting
- Clear user identification
- Security warnings about unauthorized requests
- Instructions for admin action

## 🛡️ Security Features

### **Email Enumeration Protection**
- Same response for existing and non-existing emails
- Generic success message prevents email harvesting

### **Business Validation**
- Verifies user belongs to an active business
- Checks business admin exists and is active
- Validates business subscription status

### **Audit Trail**
- Logs all password reset requests
- Includes admin notification details
- Timestamps for security monitoring
